# Hey there! I'm Ramis ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer science enthusiast with interests in Mobile Development, App Development, Cloud and Data Science. I've been working on creating and publishing services that catch market opportunities which lead me to a proficiency in Flutter and Google Cloud.

I'm also interested in and promoting Google technologies as part of my role as Co-manager in Google Developer Group for Cloud Islamabad where I have hosted and conducted various in-person and virtual trainings, workshops and hackathons. These workshops have covered Flutter, GCP, TensorFlow, Kubernetes, Git and GitHub, Firebase and other Google technologies.

I like to think of myself as a jack of all trades when it comes to tech.
You might catch me in Rocket League or Sea Of Thieves when I'm not working.
