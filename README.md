# Hey there! I'm Ramis ðŸ‘‹ðŸ’ª

I'm a computer science enthusiast specializing in Full Stack Development, Cross-Platform Mobile App Development, Cloud, and DevOps. Throughout my career, I've focused on creating and launching impactful services that capitalize on market opportunities.

I promote Google technologies as Co-manager of the Google Developer Group for Cloud Islamabad. I've organized and led numerous in-person and virtual trainings, workshops, and hackathons covering a range of technologies including Flutter, GCP, TensorFlow, Kubernetes, Git, GitHub, and Firebase.

My experience includes working with JD.com and Huawei Cloud technologies, where I honed my skills in cloud infrastructure and scalable application development. Additionally, my trainings in China provided me with invaluable insights and hands-on experience that enriched my technical capabilities. I also served as a Senior Software Engineer at Camio, the first online service to uberize freight trucking in Algeria, where I contributed to innovative solutions that transformed logistics in the region. I further expanded my expertise in backend development while working at Zode.sa, Saudi Arabia's homegrown online marketplace, where I contributed to building robust and efficient systems.

Recognized as a versatile technologist, I am known for my quick learning ability, problem-solving skills, and effective leadership both in professional settings and beyond.

When I'm not immersed in tech, you might find me unwinding with Rocket League or exploring the seas in Sea of Thieves.
